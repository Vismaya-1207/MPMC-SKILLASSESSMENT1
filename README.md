# MPMC-SKILL ASSESSMENT 1

## Aim
To write and execute  an assembly language program in 8051 to check whether a given  number is a palindrome or not.
---

## Apparatus Required
- Personal Computer  
- Keil ÂµVision software

## Theory 
A palindrome number reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g., 121, 1331).In 8051 Assembly, we can check for palindrome by:

1.Taking the number from memory (or accumulator).

2.Reversing the number (extracting digits using division and modulo by 10).

3.Comparing the reversed number with the original.

4.Displaying result (using a flag or storing it in memory).

## Output


## Result

Thus the program to execute whether a number is palindrome or not and thus the output was shown.
